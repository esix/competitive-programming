A soldier wants to buy `w` bananas in the shop. He has to pay k dollars for the first banana, `2k` dollars for the second one and so on (in other words, he has to pay `i·k` dollars for the `i`-th banana).

He has `n` dollars. How many dollars does he have to borrow from his friend soldier to buy w bananas?

## Input

The first line contains three positive integers `k`, `n`, `w` (`1  ≤  k, w  ≤  1000`, `0 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹`), the cost of the first banana, initial number of dollars the soldier has and number of bananas he wants.

## Output

Output one integer — the amount of dollars that the soldier must borrow from his friend. If he doesn't have to borrow money, output `0`.
