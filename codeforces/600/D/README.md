# Area of Two Circles' Intersection [⬀](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/600/D)

You are given two circles. Find the area of their intersection.

## Input

The first line contains three integers `x₁`, `y₁`, `r₁` (`-10⁹ ≤ x₁, y₁ ≤ 10⁹`, `1 ≤ r₁ ≤ 10⁹`) — the position of the center and the radius of the first circle.

The second line contains three integers `x₂`, `y₂`, `r₂` (`-10⁹ ≤ x₂, y₂ ≤ 10⁹`, `1 ≤ r₂ ≤ 10⁹`) — the position of the center and the radius of the second circle.

## Output

Print the area of the intersection of the circles. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed `10⁻⁶`.
