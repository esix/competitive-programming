# Spreadsheets [⬀](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/B)

In the popular spreadsheets systems (for example, in Excel) the following numeration of columns is used. The first column has number `A`, the second — number `B`, etc. till column 26 that is marked by `Z`. Then there are two-letter numbers: column 27 has number `AA`, 28 — `AB`, column 52 is marked by `AZ`. After `ZZ` there follow three-letter numbers, etc.

The rows are marked by integer numbers starting with 1. The cell name is the concatenation of the column and the row numbers. For example, `BC23` is the name for the cell that is in column 55, row 23.

Sometimes another numeration system is used: `RXCY`, where X and Y are integer numbers, showing the column and the row numbers respectfully. For instance, `R23C55` is the cell from the previous example.

Your task is to write a program that reads the given sequence of cell coordinates and produce each item written according to the rules of another numeration system.

## Input

The first line of the input contains integer number `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵`), the number of coordinates in the test. Then there follow n lines, each of them contains coordinates. All the coordinates are correct, there are no cells with the column and/or the row numbers larger than `10⁶`.

## Output

Write `n` lines, each line should contain a cell coordinates in the other numeration system.

## Examples

### input
```
2
R23C55
BC23
```

### output
```
BC23
R23C55
```
