Your task is to find the intersection of two sets of positive integers.

**Input** The input consists of two sets of positive integers *A={a1, a2, ..., aₙ}* and *B={b1, b2, ..., bₖ}* represented as two whitespace-separated lists of numbers. Each list ends with -1, that serves as an end-of-set marker. Repetitions of elements are possible in the input, but not in the output. You may assume that 0 < aᵢ, bᵢ < 10⁶ and that the sets A and B are of size less than 1000.

**Выход** is list of numbers or word "empty" if intersection is empty.
