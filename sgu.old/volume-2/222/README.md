Inspired by a "Little Bishops" problem, Petya now wants to solve problem for rooks. 

A rook is a piece used in the game of chess which is played on a board of square grids. A rook can only move horizontally and vertically from its current position and two rooks attack each other if one is on the path of the other. 

Given two numbers n and k, your job is to determine the number of ways one can put k rooks on an n × n chessboard so that no two of them are in attacking positions. 

## Input

The input file contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n²). 

## Output

Print a line containing the total number of ways one can put the given number of rooks on a chessboard of the given size so that no two of them are in attacking positions. 

## Sample test(s)

### Input
```
4 4
``` 

### Output
```
24
```
