# Ugly Number [⬀](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/)

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if `n` is an **ugly number***.


### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

### Constraints:

- `-2³¹ <= n <= 2³¹ - 1`
