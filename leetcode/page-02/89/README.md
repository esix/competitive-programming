# Gray Code [⬀](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)

An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2ⁿ` integers where:

- Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2ⁿ - 1]`,
- The first integer is `0`,
- An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit**, and
- The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

Given an integer `n`, return *any valid **n-bit gray code sequence***.

### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> n = 2
<b>Output:</b> [0,1,3,2]
<b>Explanation:</b>
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 0<u>0</u> and 0<u>1</u> differ by one bit
- <u>0</u>1 and <u>1</u>1 differ by one bit
- 1<u>1</u> and 1<u>0</u> differ by one bit
- <u>1</u>0 and <u>0</u>0 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- <u>0</u>0 and <u>1</u>0 differ by one bit
- 1<u>0</u> and 1<u>1</u> differ by one bit
- <u>1</u>1 and <u>0</u>1 differ by one bit
- 0<u>1</u> and 0<u>0</u> differ by one bit
</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
</pre> 

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 16`
