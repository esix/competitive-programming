# 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix [â¬€](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, *return the number of **negative** numbers in* `grid`.

 
### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]
Output: 3
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
