# [Additive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/additive-number/)

Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits `'0'-'9'`, write a function to determine if it's an additive number.

Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: "112358"
Output: true
Explanation: The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
             1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: "199100199"
Output: true
Explanation: The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
             1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
```

### Constraints:

- num consists only of digits `'0'-'9'`.
- `1 <= num.length <= 35`
