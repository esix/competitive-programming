# [Decoded String at Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/decoded-string-at-index/)

An encoded string `S` is given.  To find and write the decoded string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

- If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
- If the character read is a digit (say `d`), the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d-1` more times in total.

Now for some encoded string S, and an index `K`, find and return the `K`-th letter (1 indexed) in the decoded string.

 

## Example 1:
```
Input: S = "leet2code3", K = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: S = "ha22", K = 5
Output: "h"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "hahahaha".  The 5th letter is "h".
```

## Example 3:
```
Input: S = "a2345678999999999999999", K = 1
Output: "a"
Explanation: 
The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.  The 1st letter is "a".
```
 

Constraints:

- 2 <= S.length <= 100
- S will only contain lowercase letters and digits 2 through 9.
- S starts with a letter.
- 1 <= K <= 10^9
- It's guaranteed that K is less than or equal to the length of the decoded string.
- The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than 2^63 letters.
