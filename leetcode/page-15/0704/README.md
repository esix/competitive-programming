# [704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in nums. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

 
### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 ```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁴`
- `-9999 <= nums[i], target <= 9999`
- All the integers in `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is sorted in an ascending order.
