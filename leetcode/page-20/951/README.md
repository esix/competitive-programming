# Flip Equivalent Binary Trees [â¬€](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-equivalent-binary-trees/)

For a binary tree **T**, we can define a **flip operation** as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree **X** is flip equivalent to a binary tree **Y** if and only if we can make **X** equal to **Y** after some number of flip operations.

Given the roots of two binary trees `root1` and `root2`, return `true` if the two trees are flip equivelent or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:

```
Flipped Trees Diagram
Input: root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8], root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]
Output: true
Explanation: We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root1 = [], root2 = []
Output: true
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: root1 = [], root2 = [1]
Output: false
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: root1 = [0,null,1], root2 = []
Output: false
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: root1 = [0,null,1], root2 = [0,1]
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- Each tree will have **unique node values** in the range `[0, 99]`.
