# Just the Facts [â¬€](http://poj.org/problem?id=1604)

## Description

The expression `N!`, read as "N factorial," denotes the product of the first `N` positive integers, where `N` is nonnegative. So, for example,

| N   |   N!  |
|-----|-------|
| 0   |    1  |
| 1   |    1  |
| 2   |    2  |
| 3   |    6  |
| 4   |   24  |
| 5   |  120    |
|10   | 3628800 |


For this problem, you are to write a program that can compute the last non-zero digit of any factorial for (`0 <= N <= 10000`). For example, if your program is asked to compute the last nonzero digit of `5!`, your program should produce "2" because `5! = 120`, and `2` is the last nonzero digit of `120`.


## Input

Input to the program is a series of nonnegative integers not exceeding `10000`, each on its own line with no other letters, digits or spaces. For each integer `N`, you should read the value and compute the last nonzero digit of `N!`.

## Output

For each integer input, the program should print exactly one line of output. Each line of output should contain the value N, right-justified in columns 1 through 5 with leading blanks, not leading zeroes. Columns 6 - 9 must contain "`  ->  `" (space hyphen greater space). Column 10 must contain the single last non-zero digit of N!.

### Sample Input
```
1
2
26
125
3125
9999
```

### Sample Output
```
    1 -> 1
    2 -> 2
   26 -> 4
  125 -> 8
 3125 -> 2
 9999 -> 8
```
