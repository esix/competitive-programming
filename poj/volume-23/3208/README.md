# Apocalypse Someday [⬀](http://poj.org/problem?id=3208)

## Description

The number 666 is considered to be the occult “number of the beast” and is a well used number in all major apocalypse themed blockbuster movies. However the number 666 can’t always be used in the script so numbers such as 1666 are used instead. Let us call the numbers containing at least three contiguous sixes beastly numbers. The first few beastly numbers are 666, 1666, 2666, 3666, 4666, 5666…

Given a 1-based index `n`, your program should return the `n`th beastly number.

## Input

The first line contains the number of test cases `T` `(T ≤ 1,000)`.

Each of the following `T` lines contains an integer `n` `(1 ≤ n ≤ 50,000,000)` as a test case.

## Output

For each test case, your program should output the `n`th beastly number.

### Sample Input

```
3
2
3
187
```

### Sample Output
```
1666
2666
66666
```
