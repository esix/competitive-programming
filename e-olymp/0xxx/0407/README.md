On Christmas, in the evening, there were three flowers in the window, from left to right: geranium, crocus and violet. Every morning Masha cleans the dust and changes position of the right flower with central one. In the afternoon, Tanya waters the flowers and swaps left and central flowers. Print the order of the flowers after k days, at night.

Input
The first line contains a number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 12). Each of the following t lines contains the number of days k (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000).

Output
Print for each test case in a separate line three Latin letters "G", "C" and "V" (capital letters, no spaces) representing the order of flowers in k days (from left to right). Here G stands for geranium, C for crocus and V for violet.
