You want to roast a few toasts for the upcoming party. There is a frying pan, that can roast at the same time k toasts. Roasting the toast from one side takes 2 minutes. We assume that placing a toast into a frying pan, turning and removing it from the pan performed instantly. Write a program that computes the minimum time in minutes for roasting n toasts. Toasts should not be removed from the pan sooner or later that 2 minutes required for toasting one side. Each toast should be roasted from both sides.

## Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 50) - the number of toasts and pan capacity.

## Output
Print the minimum time in minutes required to roast n toasts.
