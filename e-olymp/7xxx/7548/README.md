As Happy Camper Harry pulls into his favorite campground with his family, he notices the sign: 'Campground occupancy is limited to 5 days within any consecutive 8-day period.' Harry is just starting a 20-day vacation. What is the maximum number of days he can occupy a campsite during his vacation?

We state the problem in more general terms. Suppose that l, p, v (1 < l < p < v) are integers. Campground occupancy is limited to l days within any consecutive p-day period. Happy Camper Harry is just starting a v-day vacation. What is the maximum number of days he can occupy a campsite during his vacation?
