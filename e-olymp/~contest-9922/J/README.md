# Mysterious equation [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/6286)
Little Vasya is very fond of equations. Once his sight caught the equation `x + y + xy = n`. Vasya wants to know the number of pairs of non-negative integers x and y, that are the solutions of this equation.

Since Vasya is still small, he asked you to count this amount.

## Input
One number n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹).

## Output
Print the number of pairs of solutions.

## Hint
Below given all the solutions of equation `x + y + xy = 5`

- (x, y) = (0, 5)
- (x, y) = (1, 2)
- (x, y) = (2, 1)
- (x, y) = (5, 0)


## Input example #1
