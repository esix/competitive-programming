# [The point on the interval](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/938)

The segment is given by the coordinates of its endpoints: **M(x1, y1)** and **N(x2, y2)**. Find the coordinates of **O(x, y)**, which divides it in ratio **α**.

## Input

In a single line the coordinates of segment endpoints and the number α are given. All coordinates do not exceed 100 by the absolute value.

## Output

Print in one line the coordinates x and y of the desired point, separated with one space. Print the result with two digits after the decimal point.

_Time limit 1 second_
