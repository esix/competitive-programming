# [Get a tree](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9116/problems/79186)

The connected undirected graph without loops and multiple edges is given. You are allowed to remove the edges from it. Obtain a tree from the graph.

## Input

The first line contains the number of vertices n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the number of edges m of the graph. The next m pairs of numbers define the edges. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected.

## Output

Print n - 1 pairs of numbers - the edges that will be included in a tree. The edges can be displayed in any order.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 64 MiB_
