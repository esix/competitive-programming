# Is it a Tree? [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9116/problems/79185)

Undirected graph without loops and multiple edges is given with the adjacency matrix. Determine whether the graph is a tree.

## Input

The first line contains the number of vertices n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) in the graph. In the next lines the adjacency matrix of size n × n is given, where 1 denotes the presence of an edge, and 0 its absence. The matrix is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal.

## Output

Print the message YES, if the graph is a tree, and NO otherwise.
