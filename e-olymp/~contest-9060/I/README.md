# From adjacency list to adjacency matrix [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9060/problems/78604)

Simple oriented graph is given by adjacency list. Print its representation in the form of adjacency matrix.

## Input

The first line contains the number of vertices n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then n lines are given. The i-th line contains the description of all edges, outgoing from the i-th vertex. Description starts with the number of outgoing edges. Then given the vertex numbers where the edges go. All vertices are numbered from 1 to n.

## Output

Print the adjacency matrix of oriented graph.
