# Regular graph [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9060/problems/78613)

Undirected graph is called regular, if all its vertices have the same degree.

Graph is given by list of edges. Check, is it regular.

## Input

First line contains number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) of vertices and number m (1 ≤ m ≤ n (n - 1) / 2) of edges in a graph. Then given m pairs of numbers - the edges of graph.

## Output

Print YES if graph is regular and NO otherwise.
