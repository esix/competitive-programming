# From adjacency matrix to adjacency list [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9060/problems/78603)

A simple directed graph is given with an adjacency matrix. Print its representation in the form of adjacency list.

## Input

The first line contains the number of vertices in a graph n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then the adjacency matrix is given. It is guaranteed that a graph does not contain loops.

## Output

Print n lines - the adjacency lists of the graph. Print in the i-th line the number of edges adjacent to the i-th vertex, and then the vertex numbers where these edges go in increasing order.
