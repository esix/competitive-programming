# From list of edges to adjacency matrix [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9060/problems/78607)

The simple not oriented graph is given by the list of its edges. Print its representation as an adjacency matrix.

## Input

The first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) - number of vertices and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n · (n - 1) / 2) - number of edges. Next m lines contain m pairs of integers, each pair gives one edge of the graph.

## Output

Print the adjacency matrix of the graph.
