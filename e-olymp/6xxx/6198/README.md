# Minimal Sum [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/6198)
Two arrays of positive integers are given: a[1..n] and b[1..n]. Find the permutation i[1], i[2], ..., i[n] of numbers 1, 2, ..., n, for which the sum

a[1] * b[i1] + ... + a[n] * b[in]

is minimal. Each number must be included in permutation only once.

## Input
The first line contains the number of elements n (n ≤ 100) in arrays. The second line contains the elements of the first array, and the third line contains the elements of the second array. The array elements do not exceed 106.

## Output
Print the minimal value of required sum.

## Input example
```
5
7 2 4 3 10
5 11 6 9 6
```

## Output example
```
165
