# Oddities [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/6199)
Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number 3 is odd, because it is not a multiple of two. Numbers that are a multiple of two are not odd, they are even. More precisely, if a number n can be expressed as n = 2 ∗ k for some integer k, then n is even. For example, 6 = 2 ∗ 3 is even.

Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or even. To see a common example, do an internet search for the query "is zero even or odd?" (Don’t search for this now! You have a problem to solve!)

Write a program to help these confused people.

## Input
Starts with the number of test cases n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) on a line by itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow. Each of the following n lines contain a test case consisting of a single integer -10 ≤ x ≤ 10.

## Output
For each x, print either 'x is odd' or 'x is even' depending on whether x is odd or even.

## Input example #1
```
3
10
9
-5
```

## Output example #1
```
10 is even
9 is odd
-5 is odd
```
