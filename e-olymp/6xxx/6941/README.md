# Sum of GCD [â¬€](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/6941)

Given n positive integers, you have to find the summation of GCD (greatest common divisor) of every possible pair of these integers.

## Input

The first line of input is an integer n (1 < n < 100) that determines the number of test cases. The following n lines are the n test cases. Each test case contains 2 parts: first part is the number m (1 < m < 100) indicating the number of input integers, second part includes m positive integers. The input integers do not exceed 1000000.

## Output

For each test case, show the summation of GCDs of every possible pair.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 122.17 MiB_
