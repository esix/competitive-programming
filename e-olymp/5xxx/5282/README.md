# Saddle points [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/5282)
The matrix K is given. It contains n rows and m columns. The saddle point of the matrix is an element that is minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.

Find the number of saddle points in a given matrix.

## Input
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 750). Then given n rows with m numbers in each. The j-th number of the i-th line equals to kᵢⱼ. All kᵢⱼ do not exceed 1000 by absolute value.

## Output
Print the number of saddle points.
