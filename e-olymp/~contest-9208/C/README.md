# [Maximum by minimum](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9208/problems/80030)

An oriented unweighted graph is given. Find in it a vertex, the shortest distance from which to the given one is maximum, and print this distance.

## Input

First line contains three positive integers n, m и s (1 ≤ s ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 20000) - the number of vertices and edges in the graph and the number of given vertex. In the next m lines the graph edges are given. Each edge is given with the pair of numbers - the starting and the ending point.

## Output

Print one integer - the required shortest distance.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 122.17 MiB_
