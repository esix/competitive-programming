The coordinates of four distinct points are given on the plane in order of their passing. Determine the type of the resulting quadrilateral.

## Input

The first line contains the number of shapes n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following line contains 8 integers - the coordinates of the vertices of a shape. It is guaranteed that all tests are correct. All coordinates do not exceed 1000 by absolute value.

## Output

For each figure determine its form in format given in sample output.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 122.17 MiB_
