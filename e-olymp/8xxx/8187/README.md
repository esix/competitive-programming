# Racing Gems [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/8187)

You are playing a racing game. Your character starts at the `x` axis (`y = 0`) and proceeds up the race track, which has a boundary at the line `x = 0` and another at `x = w`. You may start the race at any horizontal position you want, as long as it is within the track boundary. The finish line is at `y = h`, and the game ends when you reach that line. You proceed at a fixed vertical velocity `v`, but you can control your horizontal velocity to be any value between `-v / r` and `v / r`, and change it at any time.

There are `n` gems at specific points on the race track. Your job is to collect as many gems as possible. How many gems can you collect?

## Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers `n`, `r`, `w` and `h` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵`, `1 ≤ r ≤ 10`, `1 ≤ w, h ≤ 10⁹`). Each of the following `n` lines contains two space-separated integers `xᵢ` and `yᵢ`, denoting the coordinate of the `i`-th gem (`0 ≤ xᵢ ≤ w`, `0 < yᵢ ≤ h`). There will be at most one gem per location.

The input does not include a value for `v`.

## Output

Print the maximum number of gems that can be collected during the race.
