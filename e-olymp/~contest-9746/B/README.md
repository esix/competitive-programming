# Quadratic equation [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/911)
Write a program to solve a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 (a ≠ 0).

## Input
Three integers - the coefficients of quadratic equation are given in one line: a, b and c. The values of coefficients do not exceed 100 by absolute value.

## Output
Print in one line the message "No roots" (without quotes) if there is no roots. If equation contains only one root, print "One root:" (without quotes), space and a root. In the case of two roots, print "Two roots:" (without quotes), space, first smaller, and then larger root. It is guaranteed that if the roots exist, they are integers.

## Input example #1
```
1 -5 6
```

## Output example #1
```
Two roots: 2 3
```

## Input example #2
```
1 5 6
```

## Output example #2
```
Two roots: -3 -2
```
