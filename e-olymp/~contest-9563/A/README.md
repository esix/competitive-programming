# Transformation [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9563/problems/83863)
Lets take some positive integer n. We shall change it nest way: if number is even, divide it by 2, if odd, add 1 to it. After several such changes we always get the number 1. For example, from number 11 we get 12, then 6, 3, 4, 2 and at last 1. So in order to get 1 from 11 we need to make 6 changes.

Given a positive integer, find the number of its changes to get 1.

## Input
One positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹).

## Output
Print the number of changes for n to get 1.

## Input example #1
```
11
```

## Output example #1
```
6
```
