# Degrees of vertices [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/4764)

A simple undirected graph is given with adjacency matrix. Find the degrees of all its vertices.

## Input

The first line contains the number of vertices in a graph n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains n elements - the description of adjacency matrix.

## Output

Print n integers - the degrees of all vertices.
