# The shortest path [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/4853)

The not oriented graph is given. Find the shortest path from vertex a to vertex b.

## Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000) - the number of vertices and edges. The second line contains two integers a and b - the starting and ending point correspondingly. Next m lines describe the edges.

## Output

If the path between a and b does not exist, print -1. Otherwise print in the first line the length l of the shortest path between these two vertices in number of edges, and in the second line print l + 1 numbers - the vertices of this path.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 122.17 MiB_
