# Sweets for mushrooms [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/4359)
It seems strange, but mushrooms like soda. Moreover, Michael likes to make experiments with it. Each kind of soda has it's own level of sweetness. Michael has n containers with soda of different levels. If Michael mix two containers with levels x and y, instead of these two he will get soda with level 2 · min(x,y).

Help Michael to get soda with the highest possible level of sweetness.

## Input
The first line contains the number of containers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶). The second line contains n integers: the level of sweetness xᵢ (-10⁹ ≤ xi ≤ 10⁹).

## Output
Print the highest possible level of sweetness that can be obtained by mixing some of the available sodas.
