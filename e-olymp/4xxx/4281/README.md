# Inattention [â¬€](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/4281)
Stepan successfully passed the interview and has been working for four months in one of the most prestigious IT companies. It's time to take the project to the manager and Stepan, like a real student, does everything last night. Stepan types the text unusually very quickly, but inattentively. This time typing the last part of the text, he did not pay attention, that accidentally pressed the caps lock key. Thus, the large letters were typed small, and small letters were typed large. Other symbols he typed correctly. Stepan was so tired that he could not correct his mistakes, and he decided to sleep for a few hours.
