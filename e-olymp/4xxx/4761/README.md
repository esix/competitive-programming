The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is given. Determine whether it contains loops.

## Input

The first line contains the number of vertices n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then given n lines with n elements in each - the description of adjacency matrix.

## Output

Print "YES" if graph contains loops and "NO" otherwise.
