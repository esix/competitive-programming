# [Inverse](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9520/problems/83414)
Given prime number n. The inverse number to i (1 ≤ i < n) is such number j that i * j = 1 (mod n). Its possible to prove that for each i exists only one inverse.

For all possible i find the inverse numbers.

## Input
One prime number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶).

## Output
Print n - 1 numbers. i-th number is an inverse to i.
