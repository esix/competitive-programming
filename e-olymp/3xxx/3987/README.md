# Complete graph [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/3987)
Undirected graph is called complete, if any pair of its different vertices is connected with at least one edge. For a given list of graph edges, check whether it is complete.

## Input
The first line contains the number of vertices `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and the number of edges `m` (`1 ≤ m ≤ 10000`) in the graph. Then m pairs of numbers are given - the graph edges.

## Output
Print `YES` if the graph is complete and `NO` otherwise.
