# [The Area of the Polygon](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/60)

The coordinates of n consecutive points of polygon are given. Find the area of the polygon.

## Input

The number of polygon vertices n is given in the first line. In next nlines the integer coordinates of consecutive vertices xᵢ, yᵢ are given. It is known that 3 ≤n≤ 1000, -1000 ≤xᵢ, yᵢ ≤ 1000.

## Output

The area of the polygon with 3 digits after the decimal point.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 64 MiB_
