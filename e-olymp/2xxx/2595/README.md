# Wall [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/2595)

Vasily Pupkin decided to stick the wallpaper on the wall of size n meters in height and m meters in width. As you know, the sold wallpaper rolls have 1 meter in width and k meters in length. They are glued on the wall vertically - from floor to ceiling. Vasily wants to glue the wallpaper without horizontal joints, with solid strips only (one solid piece is glued from the ceiling to the floor). From a roll you can cut a piece the size you want. Of course, if you leave a piece of a smaller size, it will go to waste. What is the smallest number of rolls you should buy and how many meters of Vasyl's wallpaper will go to waste?

## Input
Three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, n ≤ k ≤ 100).

## Output
Print two numbers - the minimum number of rolls to buy and the total length of loose wallpaper.
