# Add All [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/1228)
The problem name reflects your task; just add a set of numbers. But you may feel yourselves condescended, to write a C/C++ program just to add a set of numbers. Such a problem will simply question your erudition. So, let’s add some flavor of ingenuity to it.

Addition operation requires cost now, and the cost is the summation of those two to be added. So, to add 1 and 10, you need a cost of 11. If you want to add 1, 2 and 3. There are several ways:

- 1 + 2 = 3 (cost = 3), 3 + 3 = 6 (cost = 6), Total = 9
- 1 + 3 = 4 (cost = 4), 2 + 4 = 6 (cost = 6), Total = 10
- 2 + 3 = 5 (cost = 5), 1 + 5 = 6 (cost = 6), Total = 11

## Input
The test case starts with a positive number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000) followed by n nonnegative integers (all are less than 100000).

## Output
Print the minimum total cost of addition.

## Input example #1
