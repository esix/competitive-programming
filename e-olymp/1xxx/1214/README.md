# Multifactorial [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/1214)

The `k`-multifactorial of `n` is denoted by `fack(n)` and is defined as the product of every positive number of the form `n – k * x`, `x` = `0`, `1`, `2`, … .

A formal definition of multifactorial is:

- `facᵢ(n) = n`, if `i ≥ n`;
- `facᵢ(n) = n * facᵢ(n – i)`, if `i < n`;

You will be given `n` and `k` and have to evaluate the value of `fack(n)`. If the result is strictly greater than `10¹⁸`, you must print "overflow".

## Input
Two integers `n` and `i` (`1 ≤ n, i ≤ 2 * 10⁹`).

## Output
Print the value of `fack(n)`. If it is strictly greater than `10¹⁸`, print "overflow".
