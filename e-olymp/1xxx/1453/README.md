Given a directed graph, that can contain multiple edges and loops. Each edge has a weight that is expressed by a number (possibly negative). It is guaranteed that there are no cycles of negative weight.

Calculate the length of the shortest paths from the vertex number 1 to all other vertices.

## Input

First the number of vertices **n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)** is given. It is followed by the number of edges **m (0 ≤ m ≤ 10000)**. Next **m** triples describe the edges: beginning of the edge, the end of the edge and its weight (an integer from **-100** to **100**).

## Output

Print n numbers - the distance from the vertex number **1** to all other vertices of the graph. If the path to the corresponding vertex does not exist, instead of the path length print the number **30000**.
