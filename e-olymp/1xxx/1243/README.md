# Least Common Multiple [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/1243)

The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of positive integers is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by all the numbers in the set. For example, the LCM of 5, 7 and 15 is 105.

You need to find the LCM of m given positive integers.

## Input

The first line contains the number of tests. Each test case is a single line of the form mn1 n2 n3 ... nm, where m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100) is the number of integers and n1, ..., nm are positive integers. All integers will be positive and lie within the range of a 32-bit integer.

## Output

For each test case print in a single line the LCM of given m positive integers. All results will lie in the range of a 32-bit integer.
