# Black Box [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/1225)
Our Black Box represents a primitive database. It can save an integer array and has a special `i` variable. At the initial moment Black Box is empty and `i` equals `0`. This Black Box processes a sequence of commands (transactions). There are two types of transactions:

- `ADD(x)`: put element `x` into Black Box;

- `GET`: increase `i` by `1` and give an `i`-minimum out of all integers containing in the Black Box.

Keep in mind that i-minimum is a number located at i-th place after Black Box elements sorting by non-descending.

Consider the Example:


| N | Transaction	| i | Black Box contents after transaction | Answer |
|---|-------------|---|--------------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | `ADD(3)`    | 0 | 3	                                   |        |
| 2 | `GET`       | 1 | 3                                    | 3      |
| 3 |	`ADD(1)`    | 1 |	1, 3                                 |        |
| 4 |	`GET`       | 2 |	1, 3                                 | 3      |
| 5 |	`ADD(-4)`   | 2 |	-4, 1, 3                             |        |
| 6 |	`ADD(2)`    | 2 |	-4, 1, 2, 3                          |        |
| 7 |	`ADD(8)`    | 2 |	-4, 1, 2, 3, 8                       |        |
| 8 |	`ADD(-1000)`| 2 |	-1000, -4, 1, 2, 3, 8                |        |
| 9 |	`GET`       | 3 |	-1000, -4, 1, 2, 3, 8                | 1      |
|10 |	`GET`       | 4 |	-1000, -4, 1, 2, 3, 8                | 2      |
|11 |	`ADD(2)`    | 4 |	-1000, -4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8             |        |

It is required to work out an efficient algorithm which treats a given sequence of transactions. The maximum number of `ADD` and `GET` transactions: `30000` of each type.

Let us describe the sequence of transactions by two integer arrays:

- 1. `A(1)`, `A(2)`, ..., `A(m)`: a sequence of elements which are being included into Black Box. A values are integers not exceeding 2 000 000 000 by their absolute value, m ≤ 30000. For the Example we have `A = (3, 1, -4, 2, 8, -1000, 2)`.

- 2. `u(1)`, `u(2)`, ..., `u(n)`: a sequence setting a number of elements which are being included into Black Box at the moment of first, second, ... and `n`-transaction `GET`. For the Example we have `u = (1, 2, 6, 6)`.

The Black Box algorithm supposes that natural number sequence `u(1)`, `u(2)`, ..., `u(n)` is sorted in non-descending order, `n` ≤ `m`, and for each `p` (`1` ≤ `p` ≤ `n`) an inequality `p` ≤ `u(p)` ≤ `m` is valid. It follows from the fact that for the p-element of our u sequence we perform a `GET` transaction giving `p`-minimum number from our `A(1)`, `A(2)`, ..., `A(u(p))` sequence.

## Input

The input dataset contains numbers: `m`, `n`, `A(1)`, `A(2)`, ..., `A(m)`, `u(1)`, `u(2)`, ..., `u(n)`. All numbers are divided by spaces and (or) carriage return characters.

## Output

Print the Black Box answers sequence for a given sequence of transactions. Each number must be printed in the separate line.
