Given an integer n ≥ 1 and an integer p ≥ 1 you are to write a program that determines  ⁿ√p, the positive n-th root of p. There always exists such integer k that kⁿ = p.

## Input

Consists of two numbers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 300, 1 ≤ p ≤ 10¹⁰⁰). It is known that there always exists an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10⁹) such that kn = p.

## Output

Print the value ⁿ√p, i.e. the number k such that kⁿ = p.
