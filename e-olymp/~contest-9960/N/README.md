# Reverse me! [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/4854)

Vasya the boy likes to reverse the oriented graphs. Help him in it.

## Input

The first number is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50000) - the number of vertices in a graph. The next n lines contain the graph in the form of adjacency list: the i-th line contains the list of vertices in increasing order that are adjacent to i-th vertex. The numeration of vertices starts with one. It is guaranteed that the number of edges in a graph is no more than 50000.

## Output

Print the reverse graph in the same format like the input graph.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 64 MiB_
