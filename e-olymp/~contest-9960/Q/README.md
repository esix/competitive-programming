# Degrees of vertices by a list of edges [⬀](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/problems/5074)

Undirected graph is given with a list of edges. Find the degrees of all its vertices.

## Input

The first line contains the number of vertices in a graph n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the number of edges m (1 ≤ m ≤ n (n - 1) / 2). The given m pairs of integers - the edges of the graph.

## Output

Print n numbers - the degrees of graph vertices.
