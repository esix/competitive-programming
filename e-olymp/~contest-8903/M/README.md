# Testing [â¬€](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/8903/problems/76961)

This year Andrew must pass testing at school including math course. He aggressively prepare himself - he already solves complex trigonometric equations easily do stereometry, but with rational numbers (fractions) things are bad, especially with their addition. He even afraids to make a mistake in writing the testing program. Do it for him. Recall that a rational number is defined as an irreducible fraction, where the numerator is an integer, and the denominator is a natural number.

## Input

Four integer - the numerator and denominator of the first fraction and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction. All numbers are not greater 105 by absolute value.

## Output

Print the numerator and denominator of the fraction's sum.
