# Maximum GCD [â¬€](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/8903/problems/76956)

Given the n integers, you have to find the maximum GCD (greatest common divisor) of every possible pair of these integers.

## Input

The first line of input is an integer n (1 < n < 100) that determines the number of test cases.

The following n lines are the n test cases. Each test case contains m (1 < m < 100) positive integers that you have to find the maximum of GCD.

## Output

For each test case, show the maximum GCD of every possible pair.

_Time limit 1 second_

_Memory limit 64 MiB_

## Input example
```
3
10 20 30 40
7 5 12
125 15 25
```

## Output example
```
20
