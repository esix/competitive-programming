# Intersection of two lines [â¬€](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/contests/9009/problems/78065)

Find the intersection point of two lines. Each line is given with the pair of points on it.

## Input

Two lines are given. Each line contains four integers, not greater than 100 by absolute value - the coordinates of the points specifying the lines.

## Output

Print in the first line 0 if lines do not intersect, print 1 if lines intersect in one point and print 2 if lines coincide. If the lines intersect each other and do not coincide, print in the second line the coordinates of intersection point with 7 digits after the decimal point.
