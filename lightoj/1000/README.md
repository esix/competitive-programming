# [1000 - Greetings from LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1000)

You are one of the most talented programmers and like to solve 
challenging problems. And my task is to make your life a bit complex by 
setting some easy looking hard brain storming problems such that you can 
sharpen your skills by practicing here. So, I wrote a code which shows a 
message like the following line:

# Greetings from LightOJ

After that the code will select a random problem for you from my 
problems database based on your previously solved problems, your skills 
and your weaknesses. But while I was coding for implementing this great 
idea, I found that, all of my problems are scattered in 2 computers. So, 
I have to merge them before running my code.

Now you are given the number of problems in each of the computers, you 
have to find the total number of problems. You can safely assume that no 
problem is stored in multiple computers. So, all the problems are 
distinct.

## Input

Input starts with an integer **T (≤ 125)**, denoting the number of test 
cases.

Each case starts with a line containing two integers **a** and **b**. a 
denotes the number of problems in the first computer and b denotes the 
number of problems in the second computer. You can safely assume that 
**a** and **b** will be non-negative and not greater than **10**.

## Output

For each case, print the case number and the total number of problems. 
See the samples for exact formatting.
 


#####Sample Input:
    2
    1 7
    9 8

#####Output for Sample Input:

    Case 1: 8
    Case 2: 17
