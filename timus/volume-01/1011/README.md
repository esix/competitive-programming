# Conductors [⬀](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1011)

## Background
Everyone making translations from English to Russian knows an English phrase "Naked conductor runs along the bus". It has two very different meanings.

## Problem
Every bus in the Ekaterinburg city has a special man (or woman) called conductor. When you ride the bus, you have to give money to the conductor. We know that there are more than `P%` conductors and less than `Q%` conductors of all citizens of Ekaterinburg. Your task is to determine a minimal possible number of Ekaterinburg citizens. By percentage, we know that there are more than `P%` conductors and less than `Q%` conductors of all Russian citizens in this city

## Input
Two numbers `P`,`Q` such that `0.01 ≤ P, Q ≤ 99.99`. Numbers are given with 2 digits precision. These numbers are separated by some spaces or "end of line" symbols.

## Output
The minimal number of Ekaterinburg citizens.

## Sample

</table>


## Notes

If there are 15 citizens and 2 conductors among them in Ekaterinburg, then there are 13 1/3 % conductors of all citizens.
