# Problem of Ben Betsalel [⬀](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1336)

*"B-but, my dear f-fellows," said Feodor Simeonovich, having diligently deciphered the handwriting. "This is B-Ben B-Beczalel's problem! Didn't C-Cagliostro prove ththat it had no s-solution?"*

*"We know that it has no solution, too," said Junta, bristling immediately. "But we wish to learn how to solve it"*

*"H-how strangely you r-reason, C-Cristo… H-how can you look for a solution, where it d-does not exist? It's s-some sort of n-nonsense.*

*"Excuse me, Feodor, but it's you who are reasoning strangely. It's nonsense to look for a solution if it already exists. We are talking about how to deal with a problem that has no solution. This is a question of profound principle, which, I can see, is not within your scope, since you are an applications type. Apparently I started this conversation with you for nothing."*

Problems that do not have solution — that’s cool, of course. However, sometimes you want to solve something in solution of which nobody doubts. For example, to present an integer in the form of ratio of square and cube of some integers. But why does this problem always have a solution?… Ok, you will see :)

## Input

The only line contains an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹`).

## Output

In the first line output an integer `m`. In the second — an integer `k`. `m²` should be equal to `k³·n`; `1 ≤ m`, `k ≤ 10¹⁰⁰`.
