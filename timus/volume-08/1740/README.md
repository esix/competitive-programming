# Deer is Better! [⬀](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=76&num=9)

*A crow is sitting on a branch with a piece of cheese in its mouth.*

*A fox is running by:*

*“Crow, are you going to the election?”*

*“No!”*

*The cheese falls down. The crow sits thinking:*

*“Would anything have changed had I said yes?”*

A Chukcha set out to go to the election. There are `l` kilometers between his yaranga and the polling station. His deer run so that they cover every `k`-kilometer segment of the way in exactly `h` hours. What is the minimal and maximal time in which the Chukcha will be able to perform his civic duty?

## Input

The only input line contains space-separated integers `l`, `k`, and `h` (`1 ≤ k ≤ l ≤ 1000`; `1 ≤ h ≤ 1000`).

## Output

Output the minimal and maximal time in which Chukcha can get from his yaranga to the polling station, accurate to at least `10⁻⁵`. The numbers must be separated with a space.
