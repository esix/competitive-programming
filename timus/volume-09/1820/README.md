# Ural Steaks [⬀](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1820)

After the personal contest, happy but hungry programmers dropped into the restaurant “Ural Steaks” and ordered `n` specialty steaks. Each steak is cooked by frying each of its sides on a frying pan for one minute.

Unfortunately, the chef has only one frying pan, on which at most `k` steaks can be cooked simultaneously. Find the time the chef needs to cook the steaks.

## Input

The only input line contains the integers `n` and `k` separated with a space (`1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1000`).

## Output

Output the minimal number of minutes in which the chef can cook `n` steaks.
