# Diagonal Difference [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/diagonal-difference)

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix `arr` is shown below:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
```

The left-to-right diagonal = `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`. The right to left diagonal = `3 + 5 + 9 = 17`. Their absolute difference is `|15 - 17| = 2`.

## Function description

Complete the `diagonalDifference` function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

- `int arr[n][m]`: an array of integers

## Return

`int`: the absolute diagonal difference

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, `n`, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix `arr`.

Each of the next `n` lines describes a row, `arr[i]`, and consists of `n` space-separated integers `arr[i][j]`.

## Constraints

- `-100 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 100`

## Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

## Sample Input
```
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
```

## Sample Output
```
15
```

## Explanation

The primary diagonal is:
```
11
   5
     -12
```

Sum across the primary diagonal: `11 + 5 - 12 = 4`

The secondary diagonal is:

```
     4
   5
10
```

Sum across the secondary diagonal: `4 + 5 + 10 = 19`

Difference: `|4 - 19| = 15`

## Note

`|x|` is the absolute value of `x`
