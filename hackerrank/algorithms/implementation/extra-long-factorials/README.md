# Extra Long Factorials [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/extra-long-factorials)

The factorial of the integer `n`, written `n!`, is defined as:

`n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1`

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if `n=30`, we calculate `30 × 29 × 28 × ... × 2 × 1` and get `265252859812191058636308480000000`.

## Function Description

Complete the `extraLongFactorials` function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

`extraLongFactorials` has the following parameter(s):

- `n`: an integer

**Note**: Factorials of `n > 20` can't be stored even in a 64-bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

## Input Format

Input consists of a single integer `n`

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`

## Output Format

Print the factorial of `n`.


## Sample Input
```
25
