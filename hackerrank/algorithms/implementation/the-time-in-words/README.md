# The Time in Words [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-time-in-words)

Given the time in numerals we may convert it into words, as shown below:

```
5:00 → five o' clock
5:01 → one minute past five
5:10 → ten minutes past five
5:15 → quarter past five
5:30 → half past five
5:40 → twenty minutes to six
5:45 → quarter to six
5:47 → thirteen minutes to six
5:28 → twenty eight minutes past five
```

At `minutes = 0`, use o' clock. For `1 ≤ minutes ≤ 30`, use past, and for `30 < minutes` use to. Note the space between the apostrophe and clock in o' clock. Write a program which prints the time in words for the input given in the format described.
