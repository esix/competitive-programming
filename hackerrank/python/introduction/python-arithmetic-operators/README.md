# Arithmetic Operators [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-arithmetic-operators)

Task
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, `a` and `b`. Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## Example
```
a = 3
b = 5
```

Print the following:
```
8
-2
15
```

## Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, `a`.

The second line contains the second integer, `b`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ a ≤ 10¹⁰`
- `1 ≤ b ≤ 10¹⁰`

## Output Format

Print the three lines as explained above.

## Sample Input 0
```
3
2
```

## Sample Output 0
```
5
1
6
```

## Explanation 0

- 3 + 2 ⇒ 5
- 3 - 2 ⇒ 1
- 3 * 2 ⇒ 6
