# Triangle Quest 2 [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/triangle-quest-2)

You are given a positive integer `N`

Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size `N`.

For example, a palindromic triangle of size `5` is:
```
1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
```

You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you.

You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

**Note:**
- Using anything related to strings will give a score of `0`.
- Using more than one for-statement will give a score of `0`.

## Input Format

A single line of input containing the integer `N`.

## Constraints
- `0 < N < 10`

## Output Format

Print the palindromic triangle of size `N` as explained above.

## Sample Input
```
5
```

## Sample Output
```
1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
```
