# Mod Divmod [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-mod-divmod)

One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing the quotient of `a / b` first and then the remainder `a`.

For example:
```
>>> print divmod(177,10)
(17, 7)
```

Here, the integer division is `177/10 => 17` and the modulo operator is `177%10 => 7`.

## Task

Read in two integers, `a` and `b`, and print three lines.

The first line is the integer division `a // b` (While using Python2 remember to import `division` from `__future__`).

The second line is the result of the modulo operator: `a % b`.

The third line prints the divmod of `a` and `b`.

## Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, `a`, and the second line contains the second integer, `b`.

## Output Format
- Print the result as described above.

## Sample Input
```
177
10
```

## Sample Output
```
17
7
(17, 7)
```
