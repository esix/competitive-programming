# Triangle Quest [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-quest-1)

You are given a positive integer `N`. Print a numerical triangle of height `N - 1` like the one below:
```
1
22
333
4444
55555
......
```


Can you do it using only **arithmetic operations, a single for loop and print statement?**

Use no more than two lines. The first line (the for statement) is already written for you. You have to complete the print statement.

**Note:** Using anything related to strings will give a score of .

## Input Format
A single line containing integer, `N`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 9`

## Output Format
Print `N - 1` lines as explained above.

## Sample Input
```
5
```

## Sample Output
```
1
22
333
4444
```
