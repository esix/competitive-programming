# Word Order [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/word-order)

You are given `n` words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for clarification.

**Note:** Each input line ends with a `"\n"` character.

## Constraints:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵`
- The sum of the lengths of all the words do not exceed `10⁶`
- All the words are composed of lowercase English letters only.

## Input Format

- The first line contains the integer, `n`.
- The next `n` lines each contain a word.

## Output Format

- Output **2** lines.
- On the first line, output the number of distinct words from the input.
- On the second line, output the number of occurrences for each distinct word according to their appearance in the input.

## Sample Input
```
4
bcdef
abcdefg
bcde
bcdef
```

## Sample Output
```
3
2 1 1
```

## Explanation

There are **3** distinct words. Here, `"bcdef"` appears twice in the input at the first and last positions. The other words appear once each. The order of the first appearances are `"bcdef"`, `"abcdefg"` and `"bcde"` which corresponds to the output.
