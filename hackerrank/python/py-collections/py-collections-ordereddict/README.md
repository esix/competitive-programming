# Collections.OrderedDict() [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-collections-ordereddict)


## [collections.OrderedDict](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#ordereddict-objects)
An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted first. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged.

## Example

### Code
```
>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> 
>>> ordinary_dictionary = {}
>>> ordinary_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordinary_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordinary_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordinary_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordinary_dictionary['e'] = 5
>>> 
>>> print ordinary_dictionary
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4}
>>> 
>>> ordered_dictionary = OrderedDict()
>>> ordered_dictionary['a'] = 1
>>> ordered_dictionary['b'] = 2
>>> ordered_dictionary['c'] = 3
>>> ordered_dictionary['d'] = 4
>>> ordered_dictionary['e'] = 5
>>> 
>>> print ordered_dictionary
OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)])
```

## Task

You are the manager of a supermarket.

You have a list of `N` items together with their prices that consumers bought on a particular day.

Your task is to print each `item_name` and `net_price` in order of its first occurrence.

```
item_name = Name of the item.
net_price = Quantity of the item sold multiplied by the price of each item.
```

## Input Format

- The first line contains the number of items, `N`.
- The next `N` lines contains the item's name and price, separated by a space.

## Constraints

- `0 < N ≤ 100`


## Output Format

Print the item_name and net_price in order of its first occurrence.
