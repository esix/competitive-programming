# Check Strict Superset [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-check-strict-superset)

You are given a set `A` and `n` other sets.

Your job is to find whether set `A` is a strict superset of each of the `N` sets.

Print `True`, if `A` is a strict superset of each of the `N` sets. Otherwise, print `False`.

A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

## Example

- `Set([1,3,4])` is a strict superset of `set([1,3])`.
- `Set([1,3,4])` is not a strict superset of `set([1,3,4])`.
- `Set([1,3,4])` is not a strict superset of `set([1,3,5])`.

## Input Format

- The first line contains the space separated elements of set `A`.
- The second line contains integer `n`, the number of other sets.
- The next `n` lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.

## Constraints

- `0 < len(set(A)) < 501`
- `0 < N < 21`
- `0 < len(otherSet) < 101`

## Output Format

Print `True` if set `A` is a strict superset of all other `N` sets. Otherwise, print `False`.

## Sample Input 0
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 23 45 84 78
2
1 2 3 4 5
100 11 12
```

## Sample Output 0
```
False
```

## Explanation 0

Set `A` is the strict superset of the `set([1,2,3,4,5])` but not of the `set([100,11,12])` because `100` is not in set `A`.

Hence, the output is `False`.
