# Set Mutations [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-set-mutations)

We have seen the applications of union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference operations, but these operations do not make any changes or mutations to the set.

**We can use the following operations to create mutations to a set:**

## .update() or |=

Update the set by adding elements from an iterable/another set.
```
>>> H = set("Hacker")
>>> R = set("Rank")
>>> H.update(R)
>>> print H
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])
```

## .intersection_update() or &=

Update the set by keeping only the elements found in it and an iterable/another set.
```
>>> H = set("Hacker")
>>> R = set("Rank")
>>> H.intersection_update(R)
>>> print H
set(['a', 'k'])
```

## .difference_update() or -=

Update the set by removing elements found in an iterable/another set.
```
>>> H = set("Hacker")
>>> R = set("Rank")
>>> H.difference_update(R)
>>> print H
set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'r'])
```

## .symmetric_difference_update() or ^=

Update the set by only keeping the elements found in either set, but not in both.
```
>>> H = set("Hacker")
>>> R = set("Rank")
>>> H.symmetric_difference_update(R)
>>> print H
set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'r', 'R'])
```

## TASK
You are given a set `A` and `N` number of other sets. These `N` number of sets have to perform some specific mutation operations on set `A`.

Your task is to execute those operations and print the sum of elements from set `A`.

## Input Format

- The first line contains the number of elements in set `A`.
- The second line contains the space separated list of elements in set `A`.
- The third line contains integer `N`, the number of other sets.
- The next `2 * N` lines are divided into `N` parts containing two lines each.
- The first line of each part contains the space separated entries of the operation name and the length of the other set.
- The second line of each part contains space separated list of elements in the other set.
- `0 < len(set(A)) < 1000`
- `0 < len(otherSets) < 100`
- `0 < N < 100`

## Output Format

Output the sum of elements in set `A`.

## Sample Input
```
 16
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 24 52
 4
 intersection_update 10
 2 3 5 6 8 9 1 4 7 11
 update 2
 55 66
 symmetric_difference_update 5
 22 7 35 62 58
 difference_update 7
 11 22 35 55 58 62 66
```

## Sample Output
```
38
```

## Explanation

After the first operation, (intersection_update operation), we get:

```
set A = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11])
```

After the second operation, (update operation), we get:
```
set A = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 55, 66])
```

After the third operation, (symmetric_difference_update operation), we get:
```
set A = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 22, 35, 55, 58, 62, 66])
```
 
After the fourth operation, ( difference_update operation), we get:
```
set A = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9])
```
 
The sum of elements in set `A` after these operations is `38`.
