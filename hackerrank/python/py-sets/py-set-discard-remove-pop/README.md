# Set .discard(), .remove() & .pop() [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-set-discard-remove-pop)

## .remove(x)
This operation removes element `x` from the set.

If element `x` does not exist, it raises a `KeyError`.
The `.remove(x)` operation returns `None`.

## Example
```
>>> s = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> s.remove(5)
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> print s.remove(4)
None
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> s.remove(0)
KeyError: 0
```

## .discard(x)

This operation also removes element `x` from the set.

If element `x` does not exist, it does not raise a `KeyError`.
The `.discard(x)` operation returns `None`.

## Example
```
>>> s = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> s.discard(5)
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> print s.discard(4)
None
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> s.discard(0)
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```

## .pop()

This operation removes and return an arbitrary element from the set.

If there are no elements to remove, it raises a `KeyError`.

## Example
```
>>> s = set([1])
>>> print s.pop()
1
>>> print s
set([])
>>> print s.pop()
KeyError: pop from an empty set
```

## Task

You have a non-empty set `s`, and you have to execute `N` commands given in `N` lines.

The commands will be pop, remove and discard.

## Input Format

- The first line contains integer `n`, the number of elements in the set `s`.
- The second line contains `n` space separated elements of set `s`. All of the elements are non-negative integers, less than or equal to 9.
- The third line contains integer `N`, the number of commands.
- The next `N` lines contains either pop, remove and/or discard commands followed by their associated value.

## Constraints
- `0 < n < 20`
- `0 < N < 20`

## Output Format

Print the sum of the elements of set `s` on a single line.

## Sample Input
```
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10
pop
remove 9
discard 9
discard 8
remove 7
pop 
discard 6
remove 5
pop 
discard 5
```

## Sample Output
```
4
```

## Explanation

After completing these `10` operations on the set, we get `set([4])`. Hence, the sum is `4`.

**Note:** Convert the elements of set s to integers while you are assigning them. To ensure the proper input of the set, we have added the first two lines of code to the editor.
