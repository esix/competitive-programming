# Check Subset [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-check-subset)

You are given two sets, `A` and `B`.

Your job is to find whether set `A` is a subset of set `B`.

- If set `A` is subset of set `B`, print `True`.
- If set `A` is not a subset of set `B`, print `False`.

## Input Format

- The first line will contain the number of test cases, `T`.
- The first line of each test case contains the number of elements in set `A`.
- The second line of each test case contains the space separated elements of set `A`.
- The third line of each test case contains the number of elements in set `B`.
- The fourth line of each test case contains the space separated elements of set `B`.

## Constraints

- `0 < T < 21`
- `0 < Number of elements in each set < 1001`

## Output Format

- Output `True` or `False` for each test case on separate lines.

## Sample Input
```
3
5
1 2 3 5 6
9
9 8 5 6 3 2 1 4 7
1
2
5
3 6 5 4 1
7
1 2 3 5 6 8 9
3
9 8 2
```

## Sample Output
```
True 
False
False
```

## Explanation

### Test Case 01 Explanation

Set `A` = {1 2 3 5 6}\

Set `B` = {9 8 5 6 3 2 1 4 7}

All the elements of set `A` are elements of set `B`.

Hence, set `A` is a subset of set `B`.
