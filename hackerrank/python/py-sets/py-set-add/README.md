# Set .add() [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-set-add)

If we want to add a single element to an existing set, we can use the `.add()` operation.

It adds the element to the set and returns `None`.

## Example
```
>>> s = set('HackerRank')
>>> s.add('H')
>>> print s
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])
>>> print s.add('HackerRank')
None
>>> print s
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'HackerRank', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])
```
