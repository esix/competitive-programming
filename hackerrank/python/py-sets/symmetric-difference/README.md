# Symmetric Difference [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/symmetric-difference)

## Objective
Today, we're learning about a new data type: sets.

## Concept

If the inputs are given on one line separated by a character (the delimiter), use `split()` to get the separate values in the form of a list. The delimiter is space (ascii 32) by default. To specify that comma is the delimiter, use `string.split(',')`. For this challenge, and in general on HackerRank, space will be the delimiter.

## Usage:
```
>> a = raw_input()
5 4 3 2
>> lis = a.split()
>> print (lis)
['5', '4', '3', '2']
```

If the list values are all integer types, use the `map()` method to convert all the strings to integers.
```
>> newlis = list(map(int, lis))
>> print (newlis)
[5, 4, 3, 2]
```

Sets are an unordered collection of unique values. A single set contains values of any immutable data type.

## CREATING SETS
```
>> myset = {1, 2} # Directly assigning values to a set
>> myset = set()  # Initializing a set
>> myset = set(['a', 'b']) # Creating a set from a list
>> myset
{'a', 'b'}
```

## MODIFYING SETS

Using the `add()` function:
```
>> myset.add('c')
>> myset
{'a', 'c', 'b'}
>> myset.add('a') # As 'a' already exists in the set, nothing happens
>> myset.add((5, 4))
>> myset
{'a', 'c', 'b', (5, 4)}
```

Using the `update()` function:
```
>> myset.update([1, 2, 3, 4]) # update() only works for iterable objects
>> myset
{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 2, (5, 4), 3}
>> myset.update({1, 7, 8})
>> myset
{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 3}
>> myset.update({1, 6}, [5, 13])
>> myset
{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 13, 3}
```

## REMOVING ITEMS

Both the `discard()` and `remove()` functions take a single value as an argument and removes that value from the set. If that value is not present, `discard()` does nothing, but `remove()` will raise a KeyError exception.
```
>> myset.discard(10)
>> myset
{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 13, 11, 3}
>> myset.remove(13)
>> myset
{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 11, 3}
```

## COMMON SET OPERATIONS 

Using `union()`, `intersection()` and `difference()` functions.
```
>> a = {2, 4, 5, 9}
>> b = {2, 4, 11, 12}
>> a.union(b) # Values which exist in a or b
{2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12}
>> a.intersection(b) # Values which exist in a and b
{2, 4}
>> a.difference(b) # Values which exist in a but not in b
{9, 5}
```

The `union()` and `intersection()` functions are symmetric methods:
```
>> a.union(b) == b.union(a)
True
>> a.intersection(b) == b.intersection(a)
True
>> a.difference(b) == b.difference(a)
False
```

These other built-in data structures in Python are also useful.

## Task
Given `2` sets of integers, `M` and `N`, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either `M` or `N` but do not exist in both.

## Input Format

- The first line of input contains an integer, `M`.
- The second line contains `M` space-separated integers.
- The third line contains an integer, `N`.
- The fourth line contains `N` space-separated integers.

## Output Format

Output the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, one per line.

## Sample Input
```
STDIN       Function
-----       --------
4           set a size M = 4
2 4 5 9     a = {2, 4, 5, 9}
4           set b size N = 4
2 4 11 12   b = {2, 4, 11, 12}
```

## Sample Output
```
5
9
11
12
```
