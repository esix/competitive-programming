# Capitalize! [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/capitalize)

You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as `Alison Heck`.

<code>
<font color="red">a</font>lison <font color="red">h</font>eck ➔ Alison Heck

</code>


Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

## Input Format

- A single line of input containing the full name, `S`.

## Constraints
- `0 < les(S) < 1000`
- The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.

**Note:** in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.

## Output Format

Print the capitalized string, `S`.

## Sample Input

chris alan

## Sample Output
```
Chris Alan
```
