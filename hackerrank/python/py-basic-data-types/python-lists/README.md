# Lists [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-lists)

Consider a list (`list = []`). You can perform the following commands:

1. `insert i e`: Insert integer  at position .
2. `print`: Print the list.
3. `remove e`: Delete the first occurrence of integer .
4. `append e`: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
5. `sort`: Sort the list.
6. `pop`: Pop the last element from the list.
7. `reverse`: Reverse the list.

Initialize your list and read in the value of `n` followed by `n` lines of 
commands where each command will be of the `7` types listed above. Iterate 
through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

## Example
```
N = 4
append 1
append 2
insert 3 1
print
```
- `append 1`: Append `1` to the list, `arr = [1]`.
- `append 2`: Append `2` to the list, `arr = [1, 2]`.
- `insert 3 1`: Insert `3` at index `1`, `arr = [1, 3, 2]`.
- `print`: Print the array.

Output:
```
[1, 3, 2]
```

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `n`, denoting the number of commands.

Each line `i` of the `n` subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.

## Constraints

- The elements added to the list must be integers.

## Output Format

For each command of type `print`, print the list on a new line.

## Sample Input 0
```
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print
```

Sample Output 0
```
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
```
