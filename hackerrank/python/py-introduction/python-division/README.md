# Python: Division [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-division)

## Task
The provided code stub reads two integers, `a` and `b`, from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, `a // b`. The second line should contain the result of float division, `a / b`.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

## Example
- `a = 3`
- `b = 5`
- The result of the integer division `3 // 5 = 0`.
- The result of the float division is `3 / 5 = 0.6`.

Print:
```
0
0.6
```

## Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, `a`.

The second line contains the second integer, `b`.

## Output Format

Print the two lines as described above.

## Sample Input 0
```
4
3
```

## Sample Output 0
```
1
1.33333333333
```
