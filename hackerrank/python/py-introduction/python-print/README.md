# Print Function [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-print)

The included code stub will read an integer, `n`, from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:

```
123···n
```

Note that "···" represents the consecutive values in between.

## Example
```
n = 5
```

Print the string `12345`.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer `n`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 150`

## Output Format

Print the list of integers from `1` through `n` as a string, without spaces.

## Sample Input 0
```
3
```

## Sample Output 0
```
123
```
