# Loops [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-loops)

## Task
The provided code stub reads and integer, `n`, from STDIN. For all non-negative integers `i < n`, print `i²`.

## Example
`n = 3`

The list of non-negative integers that are less than `n = 3` is `[0, 1, 2]`. Print the square of each number on a separate line.
```
0
1
4
```

## Input Format

The first and only line contains the integer, `n`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`

## Output Format

Print `n` lines, one corresponding to each `i`.

## Sample Input 0
```
5
```

## Sample Output 0
