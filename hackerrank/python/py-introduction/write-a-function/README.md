# Write a function [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/write-a-function)

An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

- The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
- - The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
- - - The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. [Source](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html)

## Task

Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean `True`, otherwise return `False`.

Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the `is_leap` function. It is only necessary to complete the `is_leap` function.

## Input Format

Read *year*, the year to test.

## Constraints
- `1900 ≤ year ≤ 10⁵`

## Output Format

The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.

## Sample Input 0
```
1990
```

Sample Output 0
```
False
```

## Explanation 0

1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.
