# Compress the String! [⬀](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compress-the-string)

In this task, we would like for you to appreciate the usefulness of the groupby() function of itertools . To read more about this function, [Check this out](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby).

You are given a string `S`. Suppose a character `'c'` occurs consecutively `X` times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character `'c'` with `(X, c)` in the string.

For a better understanding of the problem, check the explanation.

## Input Format

- A single line of input consisting of the string `S`.

## Output Format

- A single line of output consisting of the modified string.

## Constraints
- All the characters of `S` denote integers between `0` and `9`.
- `1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10⁴`

## Sample Input
```
1222311
```

## Sample Output
```
(1, 1) (3, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1)
```

## Explanation

First, the character `1` occurs only once. It is replaced by `(1, 1)`. Then the character `2` occurs three times, and it is replaced by `(3, 2)` and so on.

Also, note the single space within each compression and between the compressions.
