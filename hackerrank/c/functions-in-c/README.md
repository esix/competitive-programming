# Functions in C [â¬€](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/functions-in-c)

## Objective

In this challenge, you will learn simple usage of functions in C. Functions are a bunch of statements grouped together. A function is provided with zero or more arguments, and it executes the statements on it. Based on the return type, it either returns nothing (void) or something.

A sample syntax for a function is
```
	return_type function_name(arg_type_1 arg_1, arg_type_2 arg_2, ...) {
    	...
        ...
        ...
        [if return_type is non void]
        	return something of type `return_type`;
    }
```

For example, a function to read four variables and return the sum of them can be written as
```
	int sum_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    	int sum = 0;
        sum += a;
        sum += b;
        sum += c;
        sum += d;
        return sum;
    }
```

```
+= : Add and assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

a += b is equivalent to a = a + b;
```

## Task

Write a function `int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d)` which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.

## Note

There is not built in `max` function in C. Code that will be reused is often put in a separate function, e.g. `int max(x, y)` that returns the greater of the two values.

## Input Format

Input will contain four integers -  `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, one on each line.

## Output Format

Print the greatest of the four integers.

**Note:** I/O will be automatically handled.

## Sample Input
```
3
4
6
5
```

## Sample Output
```
6
```
