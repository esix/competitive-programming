# Prime Numbers [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ALDS1_1_C)

A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. For example, the first four prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5 and 7.

Write a program which reads a list of `N` integers and prints the number of prime numbers in the list.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of elements in the list.

`N` numbers are given in the following lines.

## Output

Print the number of prime numbers in the given list.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10000
- 2 ≤ *an element of the list* ≤ 10⁸
