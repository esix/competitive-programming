# Swapping Two Numbers [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ITP1_3_C)

Write a program which reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints them in ascending order.

## Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers `x` and `y` separated by a single space.

The input ends with two 0 (when both `x` and `y` are zero). Your program should not process for these terminal symbols.

## Output
For each dataset, print `x` and `y` in ascending order in a line. Put a single space between `x` and `y`.

## Constraints

- `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10000`
- `the number of datasets ≤ 3000`

## Sample Input
```
3 2
2 2
5 3
0 0
```

## Sample Output
```
2 3
2 2
3 5
```
