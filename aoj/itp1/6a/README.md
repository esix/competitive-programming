# Reversing Numbers [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ITP1_6_A)

Write a program which reads a sequence and prints it in the reverse order.

## Input
The input is given in the following format:
```
n
a₁ a₂ . . . aₙ
```

`n` is the size of the sequence and `aᵢ` is the `i`th element of the sequence.

## Output
Print the reversed sequence in a line. Print a single space character between adjacent elements (Note that your program should not put a space character after the last element).

## Constraints
- `n ≤ 100`
- `0 ≤ aᵢ < 1000`

## Sample Input 1
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Sample Output 1
```
5 4 3 2 1
```

## Sample Input 2
```
8
3 3 4 4 5 8 7 9
```

## Sample Output 2
```
9 7 8 5 4 4 3 3
```
