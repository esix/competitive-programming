# Grading [â¬€](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ITP1_7_A)

Write a program which reads a list of student test scores and evaluates the performance for each student.

The test scores for a student include scores of the midterm examination `m` (out of 50), the final examination `f` (out of 50) and the makeup examination `r` (out of 100). If the student does not take the examination, the score is indicated by `-1`.

The final performance of a student is evaluated by the following procedure:

- If the student does not take the midterm or final examination, the student's grade shall be `F`.
- If the total score of the midterm and final examination is greater than or equal to 80, the student's grade shall be `A`.
- If the total score of the midterm and final examination is greater than or equal to 65 and less than 80, the student's grade shall be `B`.
- If the total score of the midterm and final examination is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 65, the student's grade shall be `C`.
- If the total score of the midterm and final examination is greater than or equal to 30 and less than 50, the student's grade shall be `D`. However, if the score of the makeup examination is greater than or equal to 50, the grade shall be `C`.
- If the total score of the midterm and final examination is less than 30, the student's grade shall be `F`.

# Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. For each dataset, three integers `m`, `f` and `r` are given in a line.

The input ends with three `-1` for `m`, `f` and `r` respectively. Your program should not process for the terminal symbols.

The number of datasets (the number of students) does not exceed 50.

## Output

For each dataset, print the grade (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D` or `F`) in a line.

## Sample Input
```
40 42 -1
20 30 -1
0 2 -1
-1 -1 -1
```

## Sample Output
```
A
C
F
