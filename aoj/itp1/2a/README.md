# Small, Large, or Equal [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ITP1_2_A)

Write a program which prints small/large/equal relation of given two integers `a` and `b`.

## Input
Two integers a and b separated by a single space are given in a line.

## Output

For given two integers `a` and `b`, print
```
a < b
```
if `a` is less than `b`,

```
a > b
```
if `a` is greater than `b`, and

```
a == b
```
if `a` equals to `b`.

## Constraints
- `-1000 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000`

## Sample Input 1
```
1 2
```

## Sample Output 1
```
a < b
```

## Sample Input 2
```
4 3
```

## Sample Output 2
```
a > b
```

## Sample Input 3
```
5 5
```

## Sample Output 3
```
a == b
```
