# Triangle [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ITP1_10_B)

For given two sides of a triangle a and b and the angle C between them, calculate the following properties:

- `S`: Area of the triangle
- `L`: The length of the circumference of the triangle
- `h`: The height of the triangle with side a as a bottom edge

## Input

The length of `a`, the length of `b` and the angle `C` are given in integers.

## Output

Print `S`, `L` and `h` in a line respectively. The output should not contain an absolute error greater than `10⁻⁴`.

## Sample Input
```
4 3 90
```

## Sample Output
```
6.00000000
12.00000000
3.00000000
```
