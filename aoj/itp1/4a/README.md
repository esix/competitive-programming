# A / B Problem [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ITP1_4_A)

Write a program which reads two integers a and b, and calculates the following values:

- `a ÷ b`: `d` (in integer)
- remainder of `a ÷ b`: `r` (in integer)
- `a ÷ b`: `f` (in real number)

## Input
Two integers a and b are given in a line.

## Output
Print `d`, `r` and `f` separated by a space in a line. For `f`, the output should not contain an absolute error greater than `10⁻⁵`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10⁹`

## Sample Input 1
```
3 2
```

## Sample Output 1
```
1 1 1.50000
```
