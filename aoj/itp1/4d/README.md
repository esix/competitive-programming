# Min, Max and Sum [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=ITP1_4_D)

Write a program which reads a sequence of `n` integers `aᵢ` (`i=1,2,...n`), and prints the minimum value, maximum value and sum of the sequence.

## Input
In the first line, an integer `n` is given. In the next line, `n` integers `aᵢ` are given in a line.

## Output
Print the minimum value, maximum value and sum in a line. Put a single space between the values.

## Constraints
- `0 < n ≤ 10000`
- `−1000000 ≤ aᵢ ≤ 1000000`

## Sample Input
```
5
10 1 5 4 17
```

## Sample Output
```
1 17 37
```
