# Digit Number [⬀](https://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=0002)

Write a program which computes the digit number of sum of two integers `a` and `b`.

## Input
There are several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integers a and b which are separeted by a space in a line. The input terminates with EOF.

## Constraints
- `0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1,000,000`
- The number of datasets ≤ 200

## Output

Print the number of digits of `a + b` for each data set.

## Sample Input
```
5 7
1 99
1000 999
```

## Output for the Sample Input
```
2
3
4
```
